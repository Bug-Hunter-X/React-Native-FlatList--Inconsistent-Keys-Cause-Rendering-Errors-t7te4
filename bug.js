This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid or inconsistent `keyExtractor` function.  The `keyExtractor` function is crucial for FlatList to efficiently update and render items. If it returns duplicate keys or inconsistent keys for the same item over time, it can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect rendering, item flickering, or crashes.

**Example of an incorrect `keyExtractor`:**
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  keyExtractor={() => 'uniqueKey'}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

In this example, all items will have the same key ('uniqueKey'), violating the requirement for unique keys.

**Another example of incorrect behavior:** If the underlying data changes and keys aren't reliably generated, items can disappear or jump around in the list.

**This issue specifically targets scenarios where data mutations and key generation aren't in sync, or where the data structure changes subtly between renders.**
